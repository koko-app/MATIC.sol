To create a fully verified ERC20 token contract for "MATIC" with the specified price, you can use the following Solidity code. This example assumes that the contract is pre-initialized and does not include initialization logic for simplicity.

Since the contract is already deployed and verified, you would typically write the implementation that matches the interface and standards of an ERC20 token. Here's an example:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IERC20 {
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256);
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
}

contract MATIC is IERC20 {
    string public constant name = "MATIC";
    string public constant symbol = "MATIC";
    uint8 public constant decimals = 18;

    uint256 private _totalSupply;
    uint256 public constant TOKEN_PRICE_IN_USD = 6300000000000000000; // 6.3 USD in wei

    mapping(address => uint256) private _balances;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) private _allowances;

    constructor(uint256 initialSupply) {
        _totalSupply = initialSupply * (10 ** uint256(decimals));
        _balances[msg.sender] = _totalSupply;
    }

    function totalSupply() external view override returns (uint256) {
        return _totalSupply;
    }

    function balanceOf(address account) external view override returns (uint256) {
        return _balances[account];
    }

    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external override returns (bool) {
        require(recipient != address(0), "ERC20: transfer to the zero address");
        require(_balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance");

        _balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        _balances[recipient] += amount;

        emit Transfer(msg.sender, recipient, amount);
        return true;
    }

    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view override returns (uint256) {
        return _allowances[owner][spender];
    }

    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external override returns (bool) {
        _allowances[msg.sender][spender] = amount;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, amount);
        return true;
    }

    function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) external override returns (bool) {
        require(sender != address(0), "ERC20: transfer from the zero address");
        require(recipient != address(0), "ERC20: transfer to the zero address");
        require(_balances[sender] >= amount, "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance");
        require(_allowances[sender][msg.sender] >= amount, "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance");

        _balances[sender] -= amount;
        _balances[recipient] += amount;
        _allowances[sender][msg.sender] -= amount;

        emit Transfer(sender, recipient, amount);
        return true;
    }

    // Function to get the token price in USD
    function getTokenPriceInUSD() external pure returns (uint256) {
        return TOKEN_PRICE_IN_USD; // Price in wei
    }
}
```

### Key Features:
- **ERC20 Interface**: Implements the standard ERC20 interface with functions like `transfer`, `approve`, and `transferFrom`.
- **Token Details**: The contract is named "MATIC" and has a symbol of "MATIC" with 18 decimals.
- **Total Supply**: Allows you to set an initial supply when deploying the contract, which is assigned to the deployer's address.
- **Token Price**: A function to return the USD price of the token.

### Note:
- Since this contract is just a template, you should ensure that it matches the behavior of the already deployed contract at the specified address (`0x26926bd09a293823c3d8bf11065fec69b15cd7bb`) for verification purposes.
- If the contract is already deployed, you cannot change its code, but you can interact with it using the existing interface.
